Project Description: <br />
This challenge is the perfect opportunity to combine the theory of quantum mechanics and visualizations to help students understand quantum hardware. Our team will do a great job because we have first-hand experience in completing introductory quantum computing modules by QWorld and we know what information is missing to enhance the user’s learning experience. Additionally, our team consists of members from different academic backgrounds (i.e. physics, computer engineering, etc.) which will ensure that the module created by our team is more comprehensive to computer science students. <br />
Our main motivation for choosing this project is due to the lack of visual representation of how the hardware works. For example, when applying an x-gate it was not possible to visualize the effect on a qubit. Our modules will contain the necessary theory to understand quantum mechanics and an implementation of graphical representations to help students have a better grasp of quantum hardware . This allows us to create a complete picture of the theory and how they are used to create certain phenomena in real-life when using quantum computing. 
<br />
After users finish our modules, they will have a solid foundation to use theoretical knowledge and experimentation to create practical solutions and contribute to the field of quantum computing. <br />

Abstract: During this Quantum Mechanics Module a wide range of QM topics are exposed from visualization experiments, wavefunction and operators to spin and semiconductors. We found out that, this specific order and contents are a great kickoff not only to understand probabilistic phenomenons applied in quantum computing but quantum hardware behaviour. Its content is ordered from book 1: Double Slit Experiment, to book 9 as a brief journey in Quantum Mechanics.
